# Selectarr

Smart Collections in [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) - Select media with SQL-like queries.

Designed to replicate the smart playlists feature of [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/). With Selectarr, create collections like '90s Simpsons' or 'Toy Story' without needing to add every TV series, episode, or movie one-by-one. Create dynamic collections, such as including only unplayed media.

This is what Selectarr creates in Jellyfin:
